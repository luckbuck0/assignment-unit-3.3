<ul>
  <li>why does the sum=sum+x differ from when
    I use sum=+x if sum is equal to 0 why would
    the value revert back to the last number
    in the sequence if that makes sense or maybe 
    I am doing something wrong.
    let sum=0;
    for (let x of supplyChanges) 
    {sum = sum +x;}
    console.log(sum)
  </li>

  <li>
    also I know thier is a simpler way to do the last problem
    any helpful notes would be much appreciated. I feel like I'
    doing a lot when their is a much simpler way to do this.
    while(partsTotal>total) {total=total+7}
    console.log(total)
    boxesFilled=total/7
    boxesFilled= boxesFilled-1
    let leftover= 5
    console.log('A total of'+ ' '+boxesFilled+' '+'boxes were 
    filled with a excess of'+' '+ leftover +' '+'parts')
  </li>

</ul>
